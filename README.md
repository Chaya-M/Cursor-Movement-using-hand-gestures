# SMART CONTROL:CURSOR,MEDIA,MATH SOLVER
Cursor movement by hand gesture is a novel technique that enables users to control the cursor on their computer screen, control the volume and brightness and perform basic mathematical calculations with simple hand motions.
The main objectives of the project are:
->To present the pre-processing data in such a way that it can be easily interpreted and processed by the system.
->To integrate OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and digit/operator recognition.
->To ease the use of touchpad and make convenient hands-free arithmeticÂ computation.
->To focus extracting features on human hands and then matching their features to        recognize hand movements. 
->To develop a gesture-based interface that allows users to input and solve mathematical expressions without physical devices.
->To minimize the cost of hardware.
